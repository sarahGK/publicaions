This repository is for all my publicaitons.
These publications are related to my research on machine learning application on computational biology during my PhD program.

1.Empirical probability functions derived from dihedral angles for protein structure prediction.
This paper presents a general probability framework to develop scoring functions for protein structure prediction.
A class of empirical probability functions is derived by decomposing the joint probability of backbone dihedral angles and amino acid sequences.
The neighboring interactions are modeled by conditional probabilities.
All the probability functions are based on strict probability theory and some suitable suppositions to reduce computation complexity.

2.Protein backbone dihedral angle prediction based on probabilistic models.
Two types of probabilistic graphic model, maximum entropy Markov models(MEMMs) and conditional random fields(CRFs) are used to predict the backbone dihedral angles. And the results are compared to previous work using HMM, ANN and SVM.
The dihedral angle prediction problem here is: given the Ramachandran plot and the amino acid sequence, we predict in what region of the Ramachandran plot the dihedral angles pair phi/psi of each residue lies.

3.An improved Genetic Algorithm for statistical potential function design.
This paper proposed a genetic algorithm for learning the optimal parameters of statistical potential functions.

4.Side-chain dynamics analysis of KE07 series.
This paper established a linear relationship between entropy and side-chain dynamics by calculating the time autocorrelaion function of side-chains and statistically analyzing the change along directed evolution.
